#Word-Of-The-Day

It contains two scripts

1. word_of_the_day.py

This script scrapes the site http://www.dictionary.com/wordoftheday/ and fetches the word of the day and other information as follows:

a. Word of the day
b. Category
c. Meaning
d. Origin
e. Usage examples from the web

And then the information is written to the pdf file. This script can be run everyday and a pdf will be updated with the information.

2. word_of_the_day_console.py

Just run the script from console and you will get the required information directly on the command line.

So, run the scripts and enjoy reading without any advertisements. You can create your own collection of words.
